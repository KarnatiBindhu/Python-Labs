#Suppose you want to track and analyze your household expenses for a month.You have recorded the expenses for various categories, such as groceries, utilities, rent,
#transportation, and entertainment. You can represent this expense data using a Pandas Series.
#Input:
# Expense categories
#categories = ['Groceries', 'Utilities', 'Rent', 'Transportation', 'Entertainment']
# Monthly expense data (example data in USD)
#expenses = [500, 200, 1200, 300, 150]

import pandas as pd
# Expense categories
categories = ['Groceries', 'Utilities', 'Rent', 'Transportation', 'Entertainment']
# Monthly expense data (example data in USD)
expenses = [500, 200, 1200, 300, 150]
# Create Pandas Series
expense_series = pd.Series(expenses, index=categories)
# Display the series
print(expense_series)
